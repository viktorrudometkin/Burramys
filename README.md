This is a forked version of Frédéric Julian's Flym implementation.

As Frédéric is currently developing a completely new version of Flym in Kotlin from scratch, I decided to fork the current state of the master branch (25/04/2017) in order to keep the Java version. The reason for this is that a use Flym on every day basis and would like to introduce quickly some improvements to the current version.
